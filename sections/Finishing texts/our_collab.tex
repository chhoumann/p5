\section{Our Collaboration}
As described in section \ref{our_agile_approach}, we strived to utilize as much of Scrum as we could. We used the Scrum framework to create a process that was both efficient and flexible. 

As such, we had a Scrum Master, who, for all intents and purposes, strived to facilitate continuous improvement of the Scrum team. Various initiatives were implemented to help us achieve this goal, as documented in our retrospectives.

These improvements seem to have led to a more effective and flexible process. To investigate whether these improvements had a positive impact on our velocity, we created a velocity analysis of the sprints we completed in this project.
