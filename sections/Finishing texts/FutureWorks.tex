\section{Future works}
\subsection{Database Design}
We suggest that next semesters' database group(s) restructure the WordCount database, making it BCNF. 
This can be done by creating tables for file paths, and have the articles reference the table using a foreign key.
\subsection{Server and Database Structure}
We strongly suggest that the various databases of Knox migrate to a single, dedicated server.

\subsection{Analysis of Performance}
Benchmarking of databases (or papers documenting performance), controllers etc.
