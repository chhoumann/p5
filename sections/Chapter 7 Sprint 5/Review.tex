\section{Review}
The goal for this sprint was to implement functionality to support the user stories defined in section \ref{userstories}. 

\subsubsection*{What has been accomplished?}
Two of the three user stories have been implemented, but none of them have yet to be deployed to the \knox pipeline.
We have implemented functionality to fetch from Virtuoso through an API endpoint. The endpoint is written in C\#, and takes a query in SPARQL format. 

\subsubsection{What has changed in the environment?}
During the sprint, we discovered that many better solutions for RDF data storage exists. Therefore, the group chose to not implement an endpoint to the Fuseki service, but implement Virtuoso instead. 

\subsubsection*{What next?}
The PO has informed us that he will not give any of the \knox groups more assignments regarding the pipeline. 
For the next sprint, we will continue on the remaining user story, and deploy the endpoint for the database, as to complete the user stories. 
However, each of the knox groups must implement a UI element, and we would like to restructure the database design in the WordCount database, as discussed in section \ref{DatabaseRedesign}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a simple UI element for the \knox website.
    \item Finish implementation of the last user story.
    \item Deploy the API endpoint for the RDF database.
\end{itemize}
