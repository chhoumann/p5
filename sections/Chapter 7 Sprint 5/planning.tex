For this sprint, we first transferred the remaining report backlog from the last sprint and recieved three user stories from the PO. 
From this backlog, we have formulated the goals for this sprint.

\begin{itemize}
    \item It should be possible to write RDF data to the Fuseki database using the Terse RDF Triple Language (Turtle) syntax and file format.
    \item It should be possible to send a SparQL query from the functionality layer. Using this, the group needs to be able to read data from the database.
\end{itemize}
