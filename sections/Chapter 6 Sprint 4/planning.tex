\section{Sprint Planning}
In this sprint, we aim to improve documentation and gather information about the coming sprints.

We did not do any formal sprint planning for this sprint. This decision was made because we already had predefined tasks for improvements we could make to the documentation for this sprint, and research is hard to define as a task, as it usually results in many newly discovered tasks.

We will reserve the improvements to our planning process for the next sprint.
