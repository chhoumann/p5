The initial spring for the second iteration of \knox main purpose was for the teams to gather information 
about the current state of \knox including what was developed last semester as well as what features was 
left hanging when it came to an end last time it was ran. Another goal for the the sprint was to gain a 
good enough understanding of the current framework to be able plan out the needed development steps to 
plan the implementation of a search engine during the next sprint. 
To facility the main purpose of the sprint the goal for our team was to make sure that everyone had 
access to all the databases currently deployed on the \knox project. Furthermore a suitable understanding 
of the codebase and the current server structure is needed for the next sprint.
