\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
The main purpose of this semester project was to obtain knowledge and experience in analysis, design, implementation and evaluation of complex software systems in a large development environment \cite{AAULearningGoals5thSemester}.

During the span of this project, we implemented a WordCount API for the \knox{} Search Engine, which included a reworked database design. We also implemented an RDF API, which encapsulated a Virtuoso SPARQL endpoint.

We evaluated the database redesign with normal forms, and found our initial design insufficient. For this reason, we redesigned our redesign which made the database TNF.

As we implemented these APIs, we collaborated with the other groups in the project, which included various forms of testing and refining of tasks. Each group was represented in the project during Scrum-of-Scrums meetings where the \knox{} product owner and a representative from each team discussed issues, planning, and purpose of the sprints.

Our group adhered to the Scrum group structure, which included a Product Owner, the Scrum master, and multiple developers.
As a whole, our Scrum team strove for continuous improvement, which is reflected in our increased productivity throughout the project --- as documented in section \ref{sec:velocityAnalysis}.

Ultimately, we feel as though the concept of \knox{} is good, however the execution was unfortunate.
We believe that the positive workflow we experienced internally may also flourish across group collaboration in future iterations of \knox{} when the issues discussed in section \ref{sec:knoxCollab} have been addressed.
