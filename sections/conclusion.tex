\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
There are probably still some bugs in the theme. If you should find one, then please submit it on \url{https://github.com/jkjaer/aauLatexTemplates}.

The code that we overtook from last year for the search engine was incomplete and did not work.
We therefore implemented the database from scratch using C\# and the Entity Framework Core.
Our first attempt at this went well as is fulfilled the requirements provided by the Product Owner. 
This was verified through an end to end test where all layers participated.
However, despite this, the design had a major flaw in terms of excessive memory consumption. 
Fortunately, near the end of the project, we were able to allocate time to a redesign which addressed this problem.
We were unable to create a BCNF design on time though, and we therefore believe that the database group next year should prioritize this.

[insert rdf database conclusion here]

Both databases were tested using Postman to ensure that the endpoints work as intended.
A few unit tests were also written for JSON validator, however the database functionality itself remains largely untested as we cannot, and should not, test a framework.
