\section{Velocity Analysis}\label{sec:velocityAnalysis}
We have held multiple sessions of Planning Poker during the project, as seen in e.g. section \ref{sec:sprintPlanningSprint3}.
Doing this has allowed us to measure the development of our velocity over the duration of the project. As mentioned in sprint 3, section \ref{sec:sprintPlanningSprint3}, velocity analysis is a great way to know if team productivity is actually improving, which should be a result of us implementing optimizations and removing impediments. For this reason, we will present a velocity analysis of the sprints we completed in this project so we can document our use of agile methods to improve our velocity.
To reiterate: \textit{Velocity is measured by taking the sum of the estimates of each completed task in a sprint\cite{sutherlandScrumArtDoing2014}.}

Once velocity has been measured over multiple sprints, one can begin tracking and analyzing how the velocity changes over time. This can be useful to measure how the aforementioned experiments or changes to processes affect the team's velocity.

Burndown charts can be a useful method of visualizing project or sprint progress over time. In essence, they measure the amount of work left, in relation to the amount of work that has been completed. They are especially useful in Scrum and Agile projects\cite{HowCreateBurndown2021}. We will, however, not create such charts for our project. One reason is a lack of data, as we did not create estimates until sprint 3.
In addition, we shortened the sprints to a duration of two weeks each, which would have given us 4 workdays per sprint. Creating a sprint burndown chart over such a short duration would have given little value to the process quality.
Likewise, creating a product burndown chart for our layer would have been almost impossible, as a product backlog to measure against did not exist most of the time.

Instead, we have opted to sum the estimates of each task in a sprint, and then use this to calculate the velocity for the sprint. We used that estimate to measure against when selecting tasks in the following sprints, trying to achieve the same or better velocity. Figure \ref{img:velocityOverTime} shows this data and how the velocity of the project has increased over time.

There can be many possible explanations for the increase in velocity, but we believe it to be the product of a continuous improvement process.
After most sprints, we have reflected upon our process and attempted to improve it in the following sprint.

Notably, we had a low velocity in the first two sprints. This is, in no small part, due to a lack of planning and organization. In the following sprints, we improved our process, and gained a much higher velocity as a result.
This is especially clear when we, from sprint 4, changed the sprint duration from four weeks to two weeks, yet still increased velocity.
A possible explanation is that we, starting from sprint 3, got stricter in our granularization and specification of tasks, which created less ambiguity while working.
The third sprint seems to have been the turning point in our process and approach. We changed our planning poker strategy, changed how we acquired user stories, and other process improvements. This was beneficial to our productivity, as documented in figure \ref{img:velocityOverTime}.

A valuable lesson was learned in sprint 4, where we found that we had to be careful to fix issues as they occur. The longer an issue remains unsolved, the more expensive it becomes to resolve it.

In sprint 6, our velocity decreased by about ten points. This seems like a step back --- and it is --- but we learned something valuable from it.
First, during the sprint, we removed tasks from the sprint, as we realized that they were not needed. 
Secondly, we worked on tasks during the sprint which required collaboration and communication with other teams. This caused multiple delays, as we had to wait for other teams to either respond, or to finish their work. Therefore, in the future, we believe that we should both assign more points to such tasks, but should also be careful not to spend too much time waiting, and instead shift focus while waiting for the other teams. Of course, it is not possible to spend all waiting time on another task, as we had to actively respond to their queries during that time as well.

In general, we are very satisfied with our improvements throughout the project. Our process and approach have improved, and we have learned from our experiences. More importantly, we managed to rapidly put what we learned to use, and fix impediments quickly, which visibly improved our velocity.
