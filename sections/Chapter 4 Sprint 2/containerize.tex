\section{Containerizing}
Once the data access technology was decided on, the next step for us was to consider whether to put the WordCount database inside a Docker container, as we had originally decided to do with Virtuoso. The benefit of using Docker, meant that we could easily set up a local development database environment that had the required dependencies on all our computers. Using Docker also meant that we would be able to set up proper encapulation due to the way access can be managed. This was one of the key requirements that we had, as we wanted to streamline how the \knox{} project performed operations on the database, which is through an API end-point. 
Similarly we wanted to containerize the aforementioned end-point as well. That way we could bridge the two containers through a network, such that the only access to the database would be through said end-point.
The added benefit of setting up the database and the end-point in Docker, was that the previously mentioned structure could easily be set up on the university servers once we wanted to go into production.
Unfortunately, due to lack of time remaining in this sprint, we had to push the development of this into the third sprint.
