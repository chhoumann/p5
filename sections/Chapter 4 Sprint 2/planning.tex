\section{Sprint Planning}
\subsection*{Knox Goal}
The goal for this sprint was to make the search engine operational.

In order to establish a common understanding of the requirements, a status can be seen in \secref


\subsection*{Backlog}
Based on this goal, we evaluated that the following tasks were relevant to fulfill the requirement:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a development environment with Docker.
    \item Research how to implement Virtuoso.
    \item Containerize a C# API for Virtuoso within Docker.
    \item Containerize Virtuoso within Docker.
    \item Establish a connection between the two Docker containers.
\end{itemize}

An additional requirement that we had for the sprint was to finish writing the report sections related to the first \knox{} sprint.

The expected difficulties for this sprint included possible delays in delivery of requested features from other groups, due to the uncertainty that the other groups had of their requirements.
