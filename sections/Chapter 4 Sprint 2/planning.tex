\section{Sprint Planning}
\subsection*{Knox Goal}
The goal for this sprint was to make the search engine operational.

The following list illustrates the current state of the \knox{} project within each layer and what features needs to be implemented in order for the search engine to become operational. This list is also the basis for our backlog.

\subsection*{Backlog}
Based on the missing features for our layer, we evaluated that the following tasks were relevant to fulfill to meet the requirement of a functional search engine:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a development environment with Docker.
    \item Research how to implement Virtuoso.
    \item Containerize a C\# API for Virtuoso within Docker.
    \item Containerize Virtuoso within Docker.
    \item Establish a connection between the two Docker containers.
\end{itemize}

An additional requirement that we had for the sprint was to finish writing the report sections related to the first \knox{} sprint.

The expected difficulties for this sprint included possible delays in delivery of requested features from other groups, due to the uncertainty that the other groups had of their requirements.
