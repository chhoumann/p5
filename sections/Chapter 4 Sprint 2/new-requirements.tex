\section{New requirements} \label{ssec:newRequirements}
During the sprint, it was realized that the initial requirements from the \knox{} project had been too vague in their definition. This led to a lack of a shared understanding between the groups, the product owner and the supervisors, as to what an operational search engine entailed. For our group, the initial understanding of the requirement was that the existing APIs were sufficient and therefore our attention turned to understanding Virtuoso, despite our intention to rewrite the original code to C\#. 
As the sprint progressed the requirements for the \knox{} project changed and became significantly more specific and as a result, the requirements for the database layer changed. It became clear that virtuoso was not a requirement at this stage, but extending the services for the WordCount database was. As a result, we decided to redirect our attention to our initial goal, which was to rewrite the original codebase from Java to C\# and add the required extra features.

In order to successfully transition the codebase into C\#, an impediment was to first decide on which type of data access we wanted to use.
