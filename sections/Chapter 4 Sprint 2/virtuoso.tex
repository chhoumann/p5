\section{Virtuoso}
During our research, we found that Virtuoso is a high-performance object-relational SQL database, which is highly effective at storing and querying RDF data. It supports SPARQL queries inside of SQL queries, and the use of SPARQL instead of SQL \cite{VirtuosoDataAcces}. SPARQL is an acronym for SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language, which is an RDF query language \cite{WhatIsSPARQL}.
The Resource Descriptor Framework (RDF) data model relies on triples in the form of \texttt{<subject, predicate, object>} to represent RDF data\cite{ResourceDescriptionFramework2021}. For example, take the statement \texttt{Person X has answered questionnaire Q}. Our subject is \texttt{Person X}, our predicate is \texttt{has answered}, and our object is \texttt{questionnaire Q}. Given enough triples such as this one, one could form a graph over the data, which is what \knox{} attempts to do with the knowledge graph.


Virtuoso supports access to the database through Open DataBase Connectivity (ODBC).
ADO.NET is an older framework for C\# which can give database access to databases that are ODBC compliant\cite{VirtuosoODBC}.

After the initial research, we attempted to set up a Virtuoso server on a Virtual machine. This was a partial success: we created a database and were able to access it through the GUI in a browser, but were unable to make HTTP requests to the server.

The next step would be to set up Virtuoso, and an API for it, in a development environment that uses Docker.
