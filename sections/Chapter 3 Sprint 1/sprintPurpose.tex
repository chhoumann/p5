\section{Sprint Purpose}
The initial sprint for the second iteration of \knox{} main purpose was for the teams to gather information about the current state of \knox{} including what was developed last semester as well as which features were unfinished last year. 
Another goal for the sprint was to gain a good enough understanding of the current framework to be able to plan out the needed development steps to plan the implementation of a search engine during the next sprint. 
To facilitate the main purpose of the sprint, the goal for our team was to make sure that everyone had access to all the databases currently deployed on the \knox{} project. 
Furthermore, a suitable understanding of the codebase and the current server structure, is needed for the next sprint.
