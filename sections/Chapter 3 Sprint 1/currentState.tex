\subsection{The Current \knox{} Databases}
The previous group set up a PostgreSQL database on \texttt{node02} to store information about word count in articles from \texttt{Nordjyske} and \texttt{Grundfos}. We will refer to this database as the WordCount database.

Figure \ref{olddatabase} shows an ER diagram of the database as we received it from the previous group.

The previous group also deployed Apache Jena Fuseki on \texttt{node01}. They chose to use HDT format, claiming that it is faster for querying than TDP\cite{knox2020}. 
The setup is used to store the knowledge graph used in \knox{}.
We will refer to this database as the Fuseki database. 

The previous group chose to develop API endpoints for both databases using Java.
The Fuseki database endpoint could be used to store knowledge graphs, and convert the data to HDT format. The API endpoint solution for the WordCount database contained a prototype for getting the ratio of how often a word occurs in an article compared to other occurring words.
There is no API for reading this data, only for writing. Currently, the database is being accessed directly by the functionality layer. 

Overall, not much code was written, and its quality is unknown due to a lack of testing and documentation.
The Java language convention was also not followed\cite{java_convention}, making it difficult to comprehend.
It appears as though no structure was established, making it difficult to navigate the code. 
Furthermore, the Fuseki database is set up such that it must be restarted every time new data is written to it - otherwise, the data cannot be fetched by the other layers\cite{knox2020}.

Based on this, we have discussed what work to do and in what order.
After having read and understood the current code, we decided that the best approach would be to start by cleaning up the inconsistencies and structure.
We then decided to document what the code does, write tests for it and to address the unfortunate database implementation, to ensure that constantly restarting was no longer required.
Finally, we needed to decouple the other layers such that they were no longer directly connected to the database.

To solve these issues, it was decided that the best approach was to discard all current implementations. 
This decision was based on several factors such as unfamiliarity with the environment and the previously mentioned poor structure. 
Discarding the current implementation would additionally allow us to build the database application using C\#, a programming language that we are more familiar with, and which is also taught in future semesters. 
While doing so, we will follow a proper structure and write tests and documentation along the way. 
Moreover, it would make the system more accessible to future students as C\# is taught on the 3rd semester.
