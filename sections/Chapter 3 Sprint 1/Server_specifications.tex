\subsection{Server distribution and their specifications}
The \knox{} server system consists of six servers, each having the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS operating system installed. The servers each have 4 GiB of RAM, 2 vCPUs, and about 100 GB of hard drive space. 

Four of these nodes have no ports open to public, and serve as containers for running the various applications of the \knox{} pipeline.
These servers will be referred to as \textit{node servers} or \textit{server nodes}. The remaining two servers have port 80 and 443 open to public. These nodes will be referred to as \textit{master nodes}.
Currently, one of the master nodes run Grafana, Prometheus, blackbox-exporter, Apache, and Docker. The other master node only have a single running program, NMap.
The Docker container runs images of Portainer, Wiki.JS, as well as a PostgreSQL database.
Many of the node servers runs applications written in Java and Python, as well as databases for the applications. 
No firewalls are set in place between the servers.
