\section{Findings}
Due to the focus of our group, the first task of the sprint was to gain access to the database to make 
sure that all the documented servers were running and had the expected data and structure. 
During this process, it was discovered that the documentation for the server structure and access was lacking. 

Therefore, code and documentation from the other \knox{} groups were needed to figure out the 
required access keys for the servers. 
Once the servers were accessed, it was discovered that most of the servers were either partially empty, only containing the schema for the expected data, or filled up with mock data used last semester. 
From this discovery, it was concluded that the server was never fully set up to receive data from the previous layers in the pipeline. 

Upon examination of the codebase from last year, it was quickly deemed undocumented and untested to such a large extend that a rewrite of the code seemed necessary to gain a better understanding and overview of the way data was handled in \knox{}. 
In addition, one of the main requirements of this iteration is to improve the documentation of \knox{} and testing of the code in use. 

With this in mind, meetings with the surrounding groups were scheduled to gain a better understanding of their current and future needs.
