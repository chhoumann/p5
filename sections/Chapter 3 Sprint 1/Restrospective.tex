\section{Retrospective}
The main goal of the research sprint was to gain access to all the currently deployed databases as well 
as gaining a suitable understanding of the deployed codebase. This goal was reached during the sprint 
giving all group members database access and an overview of what was developed last year. 

As previously mentioned, this iteration discovered many possible risks due to how the documentation of the codebase and database is currently being handled. 
Due to the lack of focus on documentation last year, the project handover was overly time-consuming and led to several misunderstandings.

Due to requests from the product owner to make sure this does not happen again, an approach with an increased focus on documentation was chosen. 
This approach allows the other teams to easier understand how databases are running and should result in a less confusing handover next year.
