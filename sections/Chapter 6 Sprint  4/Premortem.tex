\section{Premortem exercise}
At the review of the sprint, the Sprint Master introduced a new concept: Premortem analysis.
\todo{describe, formally, the method/exercise}

Having created a single Epic containing all the things the group could imagine going wrong at the exam, the product owner could then immediatedly create user stories addressing the issues. 
This resulted in three epics that could be granulated further:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\textit{As an examiner I want to understand the collaboration between knox groups, agile and Scrum methodology used by the group, as well as the groups' responsibility.}}
\item {\textit{As an examinator I want to understand why the group have used CI/CD practices and how it has affected the development.}}
\item {As an examiner I want a nice report structure as to better understand the groups' progress and achievements. }
\end{enumerate}
\todo{insert picture of epic}

The experiment resulted the team having a common understanding of what was lacking in the report and a number of task regarding the report.
