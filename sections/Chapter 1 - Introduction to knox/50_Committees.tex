\section{chapter}{Committees}\label{SHARED-committees}
\tiny {\texit{The following section have been written in collaboration with other Knox project groups.}}

Committees were established, as an attempt to ensure cooperation between the different groups. Several committees were founded.

\subsection{Scrum-of-Scrums}
Scrum-of-Scrums was introduced in the Knox project as a means of helping teams obtain transparency as well as the possibility to adapt to a common development process and at the same time be informed of the progress of other groups\ \cite{agile}.
The meetings were held on a weekly basis and helped ensure that the groups had a common discourse during each sprint. 
The PO was also present during meetings, in order to ensure that the decisions made would be meaningful elements in Knox. 
During the first three sprints, the main topic of the meetings was the development of an minimum viable product.
The Scrum-of-Scrums meetings helped create the above-mentioned qualities.

Scrum-of-Scrums was beneficial to the communication between teams and helped reach agreements on how to ensure that the development process was carried out in a manner that focused on cooperation between the teams.

\subsection{DevOps}
DevOps combines various practices and tools and emphasizes the importance of implementing a DevOps culture. According to a survey, 99\% of the respondents believed that using DevOps had impacted their organization in a positive way\ \cite{Atlassian}. Using DevOps helps improve the speed of the work process, along with communication and collaboration between teams.

The DevOps committee focused on streamlining the development process, and decisions on the use of Continuous Integration were discussed during these meetings. 
Important decisions such as “definition of done” along with requirements for code standards and the rules for server use were also discussed during these meetings.
Several of the members of the committee had zero to little experience with DevOps when starting out, hence the committee worked as a platform of information sharing and collaborating on finding the most viable solutions. This helped reach a common understanding of DevOps, as well as implementing methods such as definition of done, to ensure that the process was streamlined.

\subsection{Writing committee}
During Scrum-of-Scrums, it was agreed upon that each team would collaborate on parts of the written project. The meetings were held in order to collaborate on writing these parts, to correct the written material, and ensure that it lived up to collective standards of writing.
