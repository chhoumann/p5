\section{Retrospective}
The main goal of the research sprint was to gain access to all the currently deployed databases as well 
as gaining a suitable understanding of the deployed codebase. This goal was reached during the sprint 
giving all group members database access and an overview of what was developed last time. % fik vi adgang til alle databaser

This iteration discovered many possible risks due to how the documentation of the codebase and database is 
currently being handled. The approach taken last time did not involve a lot of focus on documentation 
which makes the project handover overly time-consuming as well as creating the possibility of 
misunderstandings due to the lack of proper documentation. Due to requests from the product owner to make 
sure this does not happen again an approach with an increased focus on documentation was chosen. This 
approach allows the other teams to easier understand how databases are running making it easier for 
them to use them while also providing an easier handover next time.
