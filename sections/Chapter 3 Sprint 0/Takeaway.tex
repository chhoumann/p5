\section{Take aways}
The takeaway from the initital sprint was the handed over codebases lacked documentation to such a high 
level that it was deemed easier to add a rework of it to the backlog for the next sprint. Furthermore due 
to the lack of documentation of how the database was structured meetings with the surrinding groups was 
planned to gather information about how they believe they currently structure the data send as well as 
how they would prefer it being handled in the future.
