\section{Findings}
Due to the focus of our group, the first task of the sprint was to gain access to the database to make 
sure that all the documented servers were running and had the expected data and structure. During this 
process, it was discovered that the documentation for the server structure and how to access them was
not documented properly. Therefore code and documentation from the other \knox{} groups were needed to dig out the 
required access keys to gain server access. Once the servers were accessed it was discovered that most 
of the servers were either partly empty only containing the schema for the expected data or filled up with 
mock data used last semester. From this discovery, it was concluded that the server was never fully setup 
to receive data from the previous layers in the pipeline. 


Examining the codebase handed over it was quickly deemed undocumented and untested to such a large extend 
that in context of the database setup in use a rewrite of the code seemed necessary to gain 
a better understanding and overview of the way data was handled in \knox. 


With this in mind meetings with the surrounding groups were scheduled to gain a better 
understanding of their current and future needs. A rewrite of the codebase was also deemed necessary and 
added to the backlog. This was done to facilitate one of the main requirements of this iteration, 
to improve the documentation of \knox and testing of the code in use.
