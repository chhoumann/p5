\section{Findings}
Due to the focus of our group the first task of the sprint was to gain access to the database to make 
sure that all the documented servers were running and had the expected data and structure. During this 
process it was discovered that the documentation for the server structure and the was to access them was 
not documented probably making it so that other groups code and documentation was needed to dig out the 
needed access-keys to gain the needed server acces. Once the servers was acces it was discovered that most 
of the servers were either partly empty only containing the schema for the expected data or filled up with 
mockdata used last semester. From this discovery it was concluded that the server was never fully setup 
to receive data from the previous layers in the pipeline. 


Examining the codebase handed over it was quickly deemed undocumented and untested to such a large extend 
that in context with the database setup in use a rewrite of the code seemed to be needed in order to gain 
a better understanding and overview of the way data was handled in \knox. 


with this in mind meetings with the surrounding groups was added to the backlog to gain a better 
undestanding of their current and future needs. A rewrite of the codebase was also deemed necessary and 
added to the backlog. This was done in order to facility one of the main requirements of this iteration 
of \knox being better documentation and testing of the code in use.
