\chapter{Sprint 3}
We have chosen to combine our descriptions of the two previous sprints into one sprint. Sprint 2 was supposed to be the sprint where the search engine was fixed, but ended up being swallowed by planning and collaboration efforts between the \knox{} groups. For this reason, it also took sprint 3 to fully implement the search engine. Because of our choice to combine the two sprints, any reference to sprint 3 should be interpreted as referring to the combined sprint.
All in all the, sprint lasted from 21st of September to 4th of October.
