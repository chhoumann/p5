\subsection{Containerizing the API and database}
The final major goal of this sprint was to achieve the encapsulation that we described in the second sprint in section \ref{sec:Containerizing}. 
In order to achieve this, we had to add both the API and database to a container and create a network bridge between the two containers so that they could communicate with each other through a specified port.
