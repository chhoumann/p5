# Review

**What has been accomplished?**

- Get & post API's for the database (WordCount)
- Wordratio response objects
- Implemented CI/CD using docker and GitHub actions
- Restructured database using a code-first approach
- Repository-unit of work pattern has been implemented (encapsulation and separation of concerns)
- Development and production environment has been set up
- Report writing
- Wiki restructuring
- API for JSON schemas used for validating data sent to the API

**What has changed in the environment?**

- The structure of the objects' send from the below layer have changed; a 'publication' field has been introduced in the schema defining the object.
- We found out that the PO will not be creating a new backlog with tasks for us to solve, but that we should rather create meaningful tasks ourselves.
- We have made other groups realize that creating server-users, database schemas and other meaningless task are their own responsibility.

**What next?**

- During the scrum of scrums retrospective, we have pointed out, that we cannot keep jumping from task to task. Therefore, we have decided to implement a ticket system, to provide a structured approach to assisting other teams.
- At the scrum of scrum retrospect, many groups told that they want to work with knowledge graphs. Therefore, we should prepare for tasks regarding the RDF database.
- We should be prepared to provide assistance with the wordcount database endpoints. This included minor changes and new endpoint implementation.
