\subsection{Data access technologies}
In this section we will give an overview of the data access technologies that we had in consideration for the project.


\textbf{Dapper}
Dapper is an open source Micro ORM or Micro object relational mapper. This means that dapper is a mapping framework that helps mapping the native out queries to domain classes. Dapper is a light weight framework made for developers that prefers to use stored procedures or native query language over using a large scale ORM tool. 

Dapper it self is a NuGet library that when added to projects extendeds the IdbConnection inferface. This extension add helpers for executing a command with no return results, executing a command multiple times, executing a query and mapping it to a strongly typed list and mapping it to a list of dynamic objects. \cite{Dapper_Git}

Dappers simple approach to ORM's means that a large part of the stadard features have been dropped. This means that Dappers focuses on being a lightweight and efficient framework that should cover most of the users needs over being a fullfledge ORM.\cite{Dapper_Git} 

This means that Dapper as a framework covers our usecases with the caveat that additional time is going to be needed in order to fullfil the sprints mvp. 

\textbf{Entity Framework Core}
