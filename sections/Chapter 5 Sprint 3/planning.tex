\subsection{Knox Goal}\label{ssec:sprint3Goal}
The overall goal for the Knox project during this sprint was to get the search engine to work. To accomplish this goal the product owner specified a list of expectation that when completed would fufill a minimal viable product. The specified list is outlined below.
\begin{itemize}
	\item It should be possible to make searches in all the available databases.
	\item It should be possible to make searches using keywords in all the available data.
	\item It should be possible to make searches in all Nordjyske articles from 2017-2021
	\item It should be possible to make searches in all the Grundfos manuals, barring those that have shown to be problematic during processing.
	\item The UI should minimally be able to display a link to the given article but preferably display the title and text.
\end{itemize}
With the overall goal for the sprint outlined, a granulated sprint goal could be made that accounts for the focus of our scrum group.


Based on this observation as well as the aforementioned requirements, the MVP for our part of the sprint goal was as follows:

\textit{Make the minimally required amount of API endpoints in order to fulfill the needs for a working search functionality, and create the necessary documenation.}

\subsubsection{Backlog \& Increments}
The next step of the planning phase was to granulate the sprint goal into smaller tasks, and further granulate these into subtasks if possible.
A table of the tasks gained from granulating our sprint goal can be seen in table \ref{BacklogEstimationSprint3}. 
After granulating the tasks, a session of planning poker was held. Each individual task was evaluated by the group with the time estimation added to the table.

With the planning phase of the sprint completed, the development phase can now begin.
