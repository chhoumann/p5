\section{Sprint Planning}
%The goal for this sprint was to finish the implementation of the WordCount database as well as the API, as we did not have enough time in the previous sprint to complete this. Additionally, the goal was also to put these into a development environment in Docker.

\subsection{Knox Goal}\label{ssec:sprint3Goal}
As previously mentioned, the product owner for \knox{} provided an updated specification of requirements to be completed in order to get the search engine to function. The new requirements are outlined below. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item It should be possible to make searches in all the available databases.
	\item It should be possible to make searches using keywords in all the available data.
	\item It should be possible to make searches in all Nordjyske articles from 2017-2021
	\item It should be possible to make searches in all the Grundfos manuals, barring those that have shown to be problematic during processing.
	\item The UI should minimally be able to display a link to the given article but preferably display the title and text.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Backlog \& Increments}
The requirements that fulfill our part of the \knox{} goal, for this sprint, were realized during the second sprint. As such, the tasks related to this sprint were only related to implementing what we did not have time to do in the previous sprint. The only addition during the planning phase of this sprint was an ambition to implement a repository service and CI/CD. To estimate the time to complete these tasks, a session of planning poker was held. The tasks and their time estimate can be seen in table \ref{BacklogEstimationSprint3}.
