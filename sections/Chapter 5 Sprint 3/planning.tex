\section{Sprint Planning}
As noted in the preceding sprint, the codebase inherited from the previous iteration was deemed problematic and costly to maintain. 
Therefore our sprint goal for this iteration was based on updating the codebase to better comply with the requirements for the \knox{} goal.


Based on this observation as well as the aforementioned requirements, our sprint goal was as follows:
\vspace{\baselineskip}

\textit{Make the minimally required amount of API endpoints available to satisfy the requirements for the search engine, and create the necessary documentation.}

\subsubsection{Backlog \& Increments}
After defining the sprint goal, it was granulated into subtasks. 
With the tasks granulated, a session of Scrum poker was held in order to evaluate the time requirement of each task. 
Afterwards, the tasks were categorized by their priority and focus points.
Lastly, the tasks were divided into three different sprint increments: \textit{Wordcount API}, \textit{Write Report}, \textit{Wiki Documentation}.
