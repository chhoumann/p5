\section{Deploying the RDF API}
As mentioned in section \ref{sec:implementing_virtuoso}, we needed to deploy the API to a production environment.
We have an automated deployment system that deploys the code to the production server, as we described in section \ref{CI/CD}, which we used to deploy the RDF API.

After deployment, we ran integration tests to test that everything worked as intended. These tests were run using Postman, a platform for building and using APIs\cite{PostmanAPIPlatform}. With Postman, we sent requests to the APIs endpoints, given \knox{} test data. This data was received from the Knowledge Extraction layer, so it resembled that which will be sent to the API.
We also collaborated with the Knowledge Extraction layer to do some separate tests, which produced the same results.
