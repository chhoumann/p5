\subsubsection*{Implementing the Models}\label{implementing_new_WC_DB_models}
After having established the quality of the design of the database structures, we then implemented them.
When creating the new tables, we ensured that no loss of data occurred by not dropping the old tables and instead renamed them. 
The tables could then be dropped later after we completed the implementation of the new design.
The renaming of the tables can be seen in code snippet \ref{lst:RenamingOldModelsSQL}.

\begin{lstlisting}[
    label=lst:RenamingOldModelsSQL,
    language=SQL,
    caption=SQL script renaming the existing database structures.,
    showspaces=false,

 ]
 ALTER TABLE "Article"
    RENAME TO "Article_Redundant";
ALTER TABLE "Term"
    RENAME TO "Term_Redundant";
\end{lstlisting}

When implementing the new tables, we based them on the newly renamed tables from the old database design.
By doing this, we ensured that all data from the old tables were correctly transferred to the new ones, since each command is a transaction (see section \ref{relational_databases}).
After all data had been transferred to a new table, constraints, foreign- and primary keys were added to the tables. 
This can be seen in code snippet \ref{lst:CreatingTheNewDBModelsSQL}.
We have ensured that the changes are reversible by creating a script dropping the new tables, and restoring the structure of the old tables.
The script is found in Appendix \ref{SQLBackupScript}.

CREATE TABLE "Article" AS
SELECT * FROM "Article_Redundant";
ALTER TABLE "Article"
    ADD CONSTRAINT "Id_PRMK" PRIMARY KEY ("Id"),
    ADD FOREIGN KEY ("PublisherName") 
        REFERENCES "Publisher"("PublisherName");

CREATE TABLE "Word" AS
SELECT DISTINCT t."Word" AS "Text" FROM "Term_Redundant" t;
ALTER TABLE "Word" ADD CONSTRAINT "Literal_PRMK" PRIMARY KEY ("Text");

CREATE TABLE "OccursIn" AS
    (
        SELECT "art"."Id" as "ArticleId", "t"."Count",  t."Word"
        FROM "Term_Redundant" t JOIN wordcount.public."Article_Redundant" 
            art ON t."ArticleId" = art."Id"
    );
ALTER TABLE "OccursIn"
    ADD FOREIGN KEY ("ArticleId") REFERENCES "Article"("Id"),
    ADD FOREIGN KEY ("Word") REFERENCES "Word"("Text"),
    ADD PRIMARY KEY ("ArticleId", "Word");
\end{lstlisting}

After having implemented the new database structures, we redefined the WordRatio view.
Notice that the view is an abstraction over a \texttt{SELECT} statement, thus it is replaceable without loss of data.

CREATE OR REPLACE view "WordRatio"("ArticleId", "Word", "Count", "Title", "FilePath", "TotalWords", "PublisherName", "Percent") as
SELECT "OccursIn"."ArticleId",
       "OccursIn"."Word",
       "OccursIn"."Count",
       "Article"."Title",
       "Article"."FilePath",
       "Article"."TotalWords",
       "Article"."PublisherName",
       round("OccursIn"."Count"::numeric 
            / "Article"."TotalWords"::numeric * 100::numeric, 2) 
            AS "Percent"
FROM "Article"
         JOIN "OccursIn" ON "OccursIn"."ArticleId" = "Article"."Id"
         JOIN "Publisher" ON "Article"."PublisherName" 
            = "Publisher"."PublisherName";
\end{lstlisting}
