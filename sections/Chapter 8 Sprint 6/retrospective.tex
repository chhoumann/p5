\section{Retrospective}\label{sec:sprint6retrospective}
This last sprint went well. We generally found our execution and planning to be satisfactory. We all had purposeful tasks that were execute smoothly.

We hit our point estimation to within 10 points, which we deem acceptable. During the sprint, we removed multiple unnecessary tasks, which meant that we completed fewer points than we had planned for. Furthermore, we worked on tasks that required collaboration with other groups, which slowed down the process.

As this is our last sprint, no further improvements are planned.
