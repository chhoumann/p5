\section{Review}\label{sec:sprint6review}

\subsubsection*{What has been accomplished?}
In this sprint, we had planned to put finishing touches on the redesign of the database. We had also planned to create a basic UI component so that we could display the status of the servers. Finally, we wanted to deploy the RDF API.

We accomplished most of the tasks that we set out to do, although we are waiting for approval from another group on our UI. We have also made a video explaining the purpose and logic of our components, which we hope is beneficial to future \knox{} groups.

\subsubsection*{What next?}
While \knox{} itself isn't finished, we will no longer receive user stories, making this our last sprint.
