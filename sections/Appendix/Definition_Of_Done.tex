\chapter{Definition of Done}\label{sec:definitionOfDone}
\textit{What follows is our definition of done, as agreed upon when we started the project.}

Code should at the very least be tested (to a reasonable extent) as well as documented using XML documentation. Review your own code before asking for a review---try to optimize it and clean it.

\textbf{Testing}: Non-trivial, non-library functionality, and especially critical code must be tested a satisfying amount. For instance, if the code satisfies a business requirement, it must be unit tested such that the important methods and their edge-cases are covered.  

\textbf{Review}: Each pull request must be reviewed by other developers. The reviewers decide whether or not a piece is code sufficiently tested, readable, and documented. The reviewers can correct minor issues themselves. 

\textbf{Documentation}: A piece of code is well documented, when reviewer has reviewed the code and approved XML documentation of the code.
