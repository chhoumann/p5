\section{The Server and Database layer}

\todo{Section vedr. database laget. Hvad har vi ansvar for?}
As the server and database management group, our responsibility lies with ressource management, database setup and general server management. The surrounding layers, knowledge extraction- and functionality layer, will need to store data in various databases, on various servers. It is our responsibility to setup up the databases, access API's, as well as manage whenever changes are needed in the databases. This includes selecting exactly which servers different components should be running on.

%As for the issue regarding the confusion around group E's (Data layer (3)) responsibility domain, they are not meant to be tech support. They are called the server and database group because it is important to manage the resources and keep track of the project. This means you can update them if YOU do changes to the servers but do the changes yourself if they are related to your responsibility. If you want to have something changed in the database THEN you go through layer E via contacting/meeting with them. EVERY group has one user that has sudo permissions, this is meant to be utilized. There is just too much overhead otherwise.
%So in general, ask the database group if you need a server to deploy to, they will find a suitable node/master and then you can setup and deploy to that server. Do not for example change things set up by other groups yourself. If there are further questions, please ask.
