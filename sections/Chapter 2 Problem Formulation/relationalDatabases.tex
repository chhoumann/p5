\section{Relational databases}
A relational database is a collection of tables, known as relations. Relational databases are used to provide access to related data points.
These relations consist of rows, known as tuples. Each tuple represents an entity with specific attributes represented by the columns of the given relation.
In the context of an enterprise company, one could for example model an employee and a manager, and the relationship between them.
The goal of the designing such relations is to represent entities as intuitively as possible, making it easy to establish relationships between them.
